<h1 id="jazz-services-apis-and-instantiation">Jazz Services, APIs and Instantiation</h1>
<p>Jazz is a single monolithic process. It allocates data and code (which is data) through some classes that only have one instance of each.
This document describes the logic behind it.</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>In Jazz, all the classes that define data and metadata neither have a configuration nor do they allocate RAM. They also don’t have a
logger to write to.</p>
<p>These classes are:</p>
<pre><code>StaticBlockHeader -&gt; Block -&gt; Tuple
                       +----&gt; Kind
</code></pre>
<p>All the classes that do have configuration, a logger and can allocate memory are inherited from the <code>Service</code> class. While you will
typically instantiate many objects of data and metadata classes, you will only have one instance of each service.</p>
<p>A Service is constructed by passing a ConfigFile (a key-value store that reads a file and exposes it as keys to the Service) and
a Logger (Which exposes a variadic log_printf() function and automatically annotates time, level and thread info) to the Service
descendant constructor.</p>
<p>Services are always inherited.</p>
<p>Services, ConfigFiles and Loggers are all defined in jazz_elements::utils.</p>
<p>Services also have a start() and shut_down() methods, typically run only once when the server starts and closes.</p>
<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>
<pre><code>Service -&gt; Container
   +-----&gt; HttpServer
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some <code>Container</code> descendant owns every <code>Block</code>, <code>Kind</code> and <code>Tuple</code> instances in Jazz (no exceptions). It wraps them in a <code>Transaction</code>
object. Transactions have a common interface for both persistence <code>StoredTransaction</code> and memory <code>VolatileTransaction</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory management is handled through custom allocation methods (malloc, block_malloc) that track allocated bytes and ensure
proper alignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every <code>Block</code>, <code>Tuple</code> and <code>Kind</code> is created by one of the 8 forms of <code>new_block()</code> included in the parent class. This uses RAM from
the Container’s memory pool. These methods allow for creating Tensors from raw data, filtering rows from other Tensors, selecting items
from Tuples, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources inside a container are identified through a <code>Locator</code>. Locators have a string form (<code>///node//base/entity/key++</code>) that
is parsed into its components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containers provide a CRUD interface: (get, header, put, new_entity, remove, copy). These methods exist as a high-level interface (the
unparsed string form) and a locator-based interface (each component separately).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code execution is done via exec() (normal function calls) or modify() (external call made to services via Channels). At the level of
jazz_elements, exec() is only declared but not implemented and modify() is used only in <code>Channels</code>. Code executed via exec() corresponds
to the API apply codes predicates APPLY_ASSIGN_FUNCTION and APPLY_ASSIGN_FUNCT_CONST. It is the most basic functionality that is later
extended in BaseAPI and its descendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The class also includes methods for locking and unlocking the container or entering and leaving read and write states
(enter_read, enter_write, leave_read, leave_write), which are essential for managing concurrent access to the container.
Also, two methods for transaction management (new_transaction, destroy_transaction).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the string parsing for both locators and constants supported by the different new_block() methods is done by the <code>Container</code> class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A method <code>base_names()</code> adds (keys and a pointer to itself) to a map passed by reference. This tells an API who manages what base. (A
base is the part of a Locator that identifies a functionality).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the Container class is a robust and flexible component designed to manage complex data structures and transactions, providing
a rich API for creating, modifying, and querying data while ensuring thread safety and efficient memory management.</p>
<h2 id="container-descendants-in-jazz-elements">Container descendants in jazz_elements</h2>
<pre><code>Service -&gt; Container -&gt; Channels
               +------&gt; Volatile
               +------&gt; Persisted
</code></pre>
<p>There are three of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Channels</strong>: A Container doing block transactions across media (files, folders, shell, http urls and zeroMQ servers).</li>
<li><strong>Volatile</strong>: A Container to manage data objects in RAM as a deque, an index (map), a priority queue or a tree.</li>
<li><strong>Persisted</strong>: A Container to manage data objects in LMDB.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instantiation-and-uplifting">Instantiation (and Uplifting)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uplifting</strong> is the process of implementing a descendant of a class in another source tree –and possibly under a different
license– while still instantiating it in a (customized) Jazz server. The source of the uplifts is located below the <code>uplifts</code>
folder in the Jazz source tree and will typically have its own version control repository. The <code>.config.sh</code> file applied to the
parent Jazz repository will create the appropriate makefile and headers to compile Jazz as if the uplifted classes were part of
the Jazz source tree. You can only uplift the <code>API</code> and the <code>ModelsAPI</code> classes. An uplifted <code>ModelsAPI</code> class will typically serve
customized <code>Model</code> descendants that inherit from the Jazz <code>Model</code> class. A customized <code>API</code> class will typically restrict the
access, making parts of it inaccessible, use credentials, tokens, etc. to make a Jazz server secure for internet access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instantiation</strong>: As mentioned, you will only have one instance of each service. <code>BaseAPI</code> and therefore <code>API</code> are containers since
they need to at least momentarily allocate <code>Block</code> objects. Containers have a <code>base_names()</code> mechanism to make <code>BaseAPI</code> descendants see
where they are instantiated and call them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>instances.h/instances.cpp  in jazz_main</strong>: Is a little module that instantiates everything (callback functions, Services possibly
including uplifted ones) and provides a <code>start_service()</code>/<code>stop_service()</code> mechanism that logs and provides user feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-namespace-jazz-bebop-has">The namespace <code>jazz_bebop</code> has:</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>BaseAPI</code>: A container that routes requests to other containers</li>
<li><code>Space</code>: A common ancestor of <code>DataSpace</code>, <code>Snippet</code> and <code>SemSpace</code> that provides the space abstraction to blocks inside containers.</li>
<li><code>OpCodes</code>: The ONNX language definition</li>
<li><code>Bop</code>: The compiler and decompiler</li>
<li><code>Field</code>: A <code>Space</code> to store snippets</li>
<li><code>Snippet</code>: A <code>Space</code> to manage executable code, contains: requirements, source and object code</li>
<li><code>Core</code>: (as in a CPU-core) A wrapper around the onnx-runtime the manages data objects, sessions and other onnx-runtime details</li>
</ul>
<p>Code is executed in the <code>Core</code> class. This class descends from <code>BaseAPI</code> which is a <code>Container</code>. <code>BaseAPI</code> is also the parent of <code>API</code>.
Simply put, an API is a container. but does not permanently allocate data (it does just as long a request is being processed). Also, an API
can parse requests and route them to the appropriate container.</p>
<p><code>Core</code> is the only object instantiated by the server’s instantiation mechanism. The language (OpCodes), the compiler (Bop), the DataSpace
and many Snippets inside <code>Core</code>.</p>
<p><code>Core</code> implements the <code>exec()</code> method. It inherits from <code>BaseAPI</code> which provides control over the containers in <code>jazz_elements</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-two-flavors-of-bebop">The two flavors of Bebop</h3>
<p>You can consider Bebop (Bop) a language with two “flavors”: a <strong>formal</strong> one that can be compiled and is defined by everything in this
namespace and an <strong>informal</strong> natural language that is converted into compilable code by a <code>Model</code> in <code>jazz_models</code>.</p>
<h2 id="models-are-a-superior-form-of-code-execution">Models are a superior form of code execution</h2>
<pre><code>Service -&gt; Space -----&gt; Field -----&gt; SemSpace  [Serves Concepts]
   |         +--------&gt; Snippet ---&gt; Concept   [Generalizes Snippet to informal code]
   +-----&gt; Container --------------&gt; Model     [uses Core to compile and run solutions]
               +------&gt; BaseAPI ---&gt; ModelsAPI [serves Model descendants]
</code></pre>
<p>At the level of <code>jazz_bebop</code>, we have a compiler that converts <strong>formal</strong> compilable Bebop code into <strong>formal</strong> object code. In this higher
level of abstraction (<code>jazz_models</code>) we convert <strong>informal</strong> natural language into <strong>formal</strong> compilable Bebop code. This requires a
<code>Model</code>. How a specific model works is beyond the scope of this document. As far as the Jazz server is concerned, a <code>Model</code> is just a
<code>Service-&gt;Container-&gt;BaseAPI</code> descendant with access to the <code>Core</code> to compile, run and evaluate solutions (formal representations to
the informal input). We can think of the whole model as a <strong>resolver</strong> vs. a <strong>compiler</strong> that is used in <code>Core</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>ModelsAPI</code> can be informally seen as a <code>Core</code> that executes a higher level language (natural language) that has to be resolved into
Bebop that can be compiled and executed by the <code>Core</code>. A single service serves multiple models using the same mechanism the other
containers have: a base (a part of a locator) that identifies the model.</p>
<h2 id="api-as-a-baseapi-descendant">API as a BaseAPI descendant</h2>
<pre><code>Service -&gt; Container -&gt; BaseAPI -&gt; API  [Single http entry point aware of all Containers]
</code></pre>
<p>So far we have seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Lowest level] <code>Container</code> provides a language to define data as constants and move blocks around containers using locators.</li>
<li>[Level jazz_bebop] <code>BaseAPI</code> provides a language to access any container by base using locators, <code>Core</code> provides a language to abstract
data, tables, indexing and execute programs.</li>
<li>[Level jazz_models] <code>ModelsAPI</code> provides a mechanism to resolve natural language into Bebop code.</li>
<li>[Now] API Gives unrestricted access to everything to anyone.</li>
<li>[Highest level: Uplifted API]: Establishes access restrictions, credentials, tokens, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-baseapi-class">The BaseAPI class</h3>
<p><code>BaseAPI</code> handles everything that is neither http specific or requires code execution. It provides an interface that is on one side
http oriented:</p>
<ul>
<li>header() Allows checking metadata without memory allocation. Similar to a http HEAD request.</li>
<li>get() Supports the entire querying language (which is a subset of Bop) and returns Tensors. Similar to a http GET request.</li>
<li>put() Writes a tensor inside a container. Similar to a http PUT request.</li>
<li>remove() Deletes a tensor inside a container. Similar to a http DELETE request.</li>
</ul>
<p>And on the other side defines a subset of Bop that provides control over the containers.</p>
<p>The subset of Bop that handles queries is defined by the use of the <code>apply</code> property in an ApiQueryState structure. There are 23 codes
ranging from APPLY_NOTHING to APPLY_JAZZ_INFO. See <code>jazz_elements::channel.h</code>.</p>
<p>Code execution is done by the BaseAPI descendants (Core and ModelsAPI) by overriding the get() method to support all the apply codes
from APPLY_NOTHING to APPLY_TEXT.</p>
<h3 id="the-api-class">The API class</h3>
<p>The <code>API</code> class is a <code>BaseAPI</code> aware of every other <code>BaseAPI</code> descendant. As a <code>BaseAPI</code> itself it manages: Channels, Volatile and
Persisted. It routes its http put() and delete() methods to its parent and its get() method to either its parent, Core or ModelAPI.
<code>API</code> is called by the <code>http_request_callback()</code> callback function of the <code>HttpServer</code> class. Except for developing purposes it is
typically uplifted to provide security and access control. Note that without restrictions, the <code>API</code> can execute any code on the server
since it has access to the console via the <code>Chanel</code> container. The least harmful thing it can do is stop the server. This functionality
can also be disabled via configuration, but uplifting provides total control over the server, not just disabling features.</p>
