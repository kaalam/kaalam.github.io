<h3>Does AI live in the perfect world businesses and mainstream media are telling us?</h3>
<p>AI is living the most exciting moment in decades. All the necessary tools to explore, train and deploy deep learning models are free
software. They combine highly optimized low level CPU and GPU software with highly expressive and productive scripting languages on top
of it. This allows AI researchers to try new ideas and publish results every day.</p>
<p><b>Meanwhile, in the same planet ... </b> Most important AI researchers, <i>we just name three to avoid digressing</i>, agree that we still
need drastic changes before we can solve problems such as common sense reasoning and many more. Humans can solve these tasks even as kids.</p>
<blockquote><b>Geoffrey Hinton</b>: "'Science progresses one funeral at a time.' The future depends on some graduate student who is deeply
suspicious of everything I have said."</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
<blockquote><b>Yoshua Bengio</b>: "Engineers and companies will continue to tune getting slight progress. That's not going to be nearly
enough. We need some fairly drastic changes in the way that we are considering learning."</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Fran√ßois Chollet</b>: "For all the progress made, it seems like almost all important questions in AI remain unanswered. Many
have not even been properly asked yet."</blockquote>
<h3>Our only intention making this point</h3>
<div class="box">
<p>We obviously don't know how to solve common sense reasoning, our point is: <b>nobody does</b>, which is relevant as we continue
explaining.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="content">The "Good Old Fashioned AI" argument is partial at best</h2><p>
<div class="row">
<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
<h3>Here is how it goes</h3>
<p>We don't cite anyone as its author. The argument just got repeated to the point it is <b>common belief</b>. It goes: <i>"Long time ago,
we as humans coded the solutions to the problems, that's <b>GOFAI</b> (Good Old Fashioned AI), we figured that was a dead end and switched
to end-to-end optimization. Now, data makes the difference, and the machine creates the model using <b>deep learning</b>."</i> Many even
state that, today, major AI players can only be the data owners.</p>

<p>The least important thing is how this argument is unfair to all the researchers and achievements AI produced for over sixty years
~1950-2013 and that some of these achievements were truly game changing. We just all got used to taking them for granted. That's what AI has
always been about: the <b>next problem</b>.</p>
</div>
<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
<p>The important thing is that even in the fields in which <b>DL</b> (Deep Learning) produced major advances, as in <b>computer go</b> this
vision is partial to the point of not being true. <b>AlphaGo</b>, the program that won against Lee Sedol, the best player in the world, is
a mix of Monte-Carlo Tree Search and DL. Without the DL it is still stronger than almost the whole human population and as strong as the
best professionals in 9x9. With only the DL and no search, it just sucks. It becomes a player that plays strong and elegant moves, but does
not understand <b>why</b> or <b>when</b> they should be played. It is like a person trying to fake being a physicist by repeating random
phrases taken from academic papers in physics.</p>

<div class="box">
<p>Our point being: <b>deep learning</b> is great, but hard problems require more than just DL. You may be thinking: <i>"I can do these other
things on top of current platforms easily."</i> Well, easily, maybe, but <b>not efficiently</b> as we are about to explain.</p>

<h2 id="content">(Not really) a digression on rectangles</h2><p>
<div class="row">
<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
<span class="image fit"><img src="/kaalam/assets/images/buildings.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<p>We immediately recognize rectangular shapes as man made.</p>
<span class="image fit"><img src="/kaalam/assets/images/panels.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<p>They can be good solutions to optimizing some problem.</p>
<span class="image fit"><img src="/kaalam/assets/images/greenhouses.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<p>Some have more aesthetic value than others.<br />
And we do not just <b>build objects</b> as rectangles ...</p>
</div>
<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
<h4>... we abstract ideas as rectangles</h4>
<ul>
	<li>We build our data sets as rectangles. (like sheets and tables)</li>
	<li>Images and videos are rectangles. (in higher dimension)</li>
	<li>Neural networks are rectangles. (of units)</li>
	<li>Even words in <b>natural language processing</b> are rectangles!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
Believe it or not, the latter is true. In the online version of the Cambridge Dictionary, the many definitions of the word <b>do</b> take
442 lines, the word <b>think</b> takes 143. With just 4 you can define <b>pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</b>. In deep
learning, they all take the same: <b>one row from one rectangle</b>.
</blockquote>
<p>And that, of course, is very good, because <b>humans are very efficient pushing rectangles into other rectangles</b>.</p>
<p>We build rectangular buildings out of rectangular elements, store the energy from the rectangular panels in rectangular arrays of
batteries that, again, are rectangular arrangements of rectangular cells. In AI, we push our data rectangles into rectangular
GPUs where we compute rectangular arrays of artificial neural networks.</p>

<span class="image fit"><img src="/kaalam/assets/images/nvidia2048gpu.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<p>This beauty is a GPU. If you enlarge it, you can count 2048 cores.</p>

<blockquote>
You may be surprised to read that all the 2048 cores of the GPU not just execute the same program, but they do it exactly at the same time.
When one of the cores, as a result of a conditional branch, takes a different logical path, all the other cores wait until it finishes.
Cores can only execute the same instruction as the others or do nothing.
</blockquote>

<span class="image fit"><img src="/kaalam/assets/images/neurons.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<p>And surprisingly, many writers seriously claim that artificial neural networks are biologically inspired. But <b>that</b> would be a
digression.</p>

<h2 id="content">How we optimize software</h2><p>
<div class="row">
<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
<h3>What is a profiler?</h3>
<p>Sorry for introducing a technicality, but it is necessary. A computer program is made of smaller parts. Simplifying, we call these
parts <b>functions</b>. What a <b>profiler</b> does, is interrupt a program millions of times, registers the name of the function that
was interrupted and lets the program carry on. This way, it builds a map of how much time is spent in each function. This is used to
know what is worth optimizing. If a function only runs 1/10000 of the time, who would want to optimize that? Even if you made it ten times
faster, the difference would not be noticeable.</p>
<p>This way, when what runs <b>most of the time</b> is highly optimized, we are living in the <b>perfect world</b>. That is at least true
<b>outside AI</b>.</p>
<p>When we look at a running AI system, <b>it looks</b> pretty well optimized. Most of the processing time is spent by efficiently computing
neural networks with highly optimized code and much less is spent in the "application logic" that is expressed in "higher level" languages.</p>
<h3>So, how is the "perfect world" model for AI broken?</h3>
<p>It is broken in different ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Current platforms are only near optimal <b>in one direction</b>. If we add something like tree search, it can take 1000 times more
in a high level language than it takes in a lower level one. Suddenly, the profiler shows the pattern exactly upside down.</li>
	<li>Even when we compute "just neural networks", its efficiency depends on us <b>pushing rectangles into other rectangles</b>.
We stack fully connected layers without considering alternatives.</li>
	<li>Current platforms do not have efficient mechanisms to try ideas on <b>"just a few cases"</b>. You can, of course, build smaller data
sets to explore ideas. But some hypotheses such as <i>"An elephant is heavier than an ant."</i> inherently require less cases to be verified
than others like <i>"Martian gravity influences athletic records."</i>. This is not minor, learning is precisely about verifying
hypotheses.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
<ul>
	<li>And, less easy to explain without getting technical, besides data processing, we need <b>data storing</b> and <b>web serving</b>,
especially since data is big and needs to be computed across multiple computers. The current trend is to do these things as separate
processes. Not because it is the fastest way, it is not. We don't want to discuss about inter-process barriers or communication overhead,
neither disrespect the arguments of the architects that prefer many processes. As in the design of the Linux kernel, making it monolithic
was just an option. <b>Our point</b>: A single process has advantages we will discuss and is faster.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Converging to a solution vs. "just doing it"</h3>
<p>If you hear the phrase <b>"Turing complete"</b> applied to any system, it means the system can compute anything. There is a remarkable
theoretical framework called the <b>"Church-Turing Thesis"</b> that states (simplifying) that all Turing complete systems are equivalent.
This is a solid foundation for AI: if the brain can do it, a computer can, since both are Turing complete.</p>
<blockquote>
There is a lot of excitement about neural networks being Turing complete (except in trivial cases) since it should mean: <b>we don't need
anything else</b> to do AI.
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, we do, at least if we want it <b>before the sun burns out</b>.</p>
<p>You can read arguments on Twitter going like: <i>"Well, actually, this is more right than you think: A multiplication *is* a convolution
of one multi-digit number by another one over the digit dimension. Think about it."</i> by none other than <b>Yann LeCun</b>.</p>
<p>But, when we need a multiplication, we can choose: A <b>CPU</b> doing hundreds of millions per core per second with 0% error in 20 digit
precision or a <b>neural network</b> doing 100 per second after three days of training in 3 digit precision with a 2% error rate. (The
former is just average performance of devices costing $10, the latter a generous estimation without even mentioning its cost.)</p>

<h3>One giant leap for mankind ...</h3>
<p>... was the invention of the <b>file</b>. It happened in different steps, starting in 1940 and only resembles current file systems
since 1961. Today, we have amazing free software tools to process all kinds of files, but the creation of data pipelines is still tedious
and error prone. We have to manage many <i>"unknown file type, wrong version, option not supported, unexpected syntax"</i> errors, wait
until hundreds of gigabytes get decompressed just to check image sizes, etc.</p>
<p>We could wait until computers spontaneously get so smart that they guess what we want and do it for us using the right tools, with
optimal arguments ...</p>

</div>
<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
<p>... or just <b>make the whole process machine understandable</b>.</p>
<h3>And the same applies to APIs</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="/kaalam/assets/images/api-icon.png" alt="" /></span>We could improve on standardized ways to abstract
API details. Finding such things as: language, timestamp, expected expiry time, units, etc. Besides that, creating mechanisms to ask for
updated data in consistent ways, are things that add value and <b>simplify data processing</b>.</p>
