<p><b>kaalam</b>, which is Filipino for <b>wisdom</b>, it is a meritocratic society created around the development and deployment
of <b>Jazz</b> and related services. It is not yet a corporation, not yet funded and not related to any organization. The original
author of Jazz is a co-founder at <b>kaalam.ai</b>.</p>
</div>

<p>We are willing to find people wanting to be part of our project. This page is the <b>"Hello World!"</b> of the Jazz community.</p>

<h3>The Mangrove Forest</h3>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/kaalam/assets/images/logo_80.png" alt="" style="width:80px;" /></span>
The mangrove forest will be a recurrent theme in kaalam's brand. Trees that proudly show their roots and challenge the ocean extending
lifeforms out of their boundaries. It represents <b>life</b> and <b>respect for Asia</b>. When we invest in corporate brand, we will evolve
the mangrove forest theme. For now, we just use <b>one green mangrove leave</b> as the promise of a new life form finding its place.
</p>

<h3>Geekery</h3>

<p>So far, 100% of kaalam's members are geeks. We envision coding as a super power. Code is a formal language so it teaches rigor.
<b>kaalam</b> has not yet spent a euro and it already has everything larger companies invest huge sums trying to build, everything
built as code: Infrastructure as code, communication as code, steering tools as code, machine learning models, an unpublished algorithm that
deserved a Kaggle medal in the Zillow price, a knowledge base, a new kind of English language dataset known as The Tangle, <b>an ambitious
AI strategy</b> and a valuable code base: <b>Jazz</b>.</p>

<p>We believe managerial tasks should be kept simple and at the service of corporate goals and strategy. Strategy in a scale-up aspiring to
push over the edge is entangled with technical feasibility. We need the kind of rigor only a technical manager can deliver. You probably do
not expect the managing partner of law firm not to be a lawyer, but in tech companies the managing coder is an exception. Well, <b>we are
the exception</b>.</p>

<p>Don't take the building a "corporation of coders" too strictly. Of course, we need people to define UX, brand, marketing, regulation,
sales and everything else, but we want those people to understand how to deliver these things "as code". Meaning that it is something that
can be: created once/deployed many times, peer reviewed, tested, measured and continuously improved. Or, at least, people who want to learn
how to do that.</p>

<blockquote><b>There is a world outside technology and we are part of it</b>. We are committed in collaborating with social enterprises
that can benefit from our technology. We will build a transparent corporation that respects people, nature and law in terms you feel
proud of when explaining them to your children.</blockquote>

<p>We aspire to become <b>responsible innovators</b>. We need money to deliver, money buys commitment when you already have vision, talent
and part of the product. Some day we will deliver products in exchange for money from our investors to create more money for all of us.
After all, <b>Jazz</b> was born in the financial sector.</p>

<h3>No exclusion, no exceptions</h3>

<p>One of the advantages of creating kaalam in <b>Europe</b> is we are not bound by exclusion laws that apply in places like the US. We
have <b>planetary focus</b> and  design for billions of users. If you happen to be born in Iran, Cuba, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, Crimea
or wherever, you are just as welcome as anybody else.</p>

<h3>First bootstrapping, then funding</h3>

<div class="box">
<p><b>There is no substitute for doing.</b></p>
</div>

<p>We believe in doing it the right way: <b>First</b> proving that we can become a player capable of achieving major advances in AI and
<b>then</b> raising money.</p>

<p>We want others to respect us for the same thing we respect others: <b>delivering amazing technology</b>. We definitely believe in
meritocracy, we need help, we want to find people that believe in the idea enough to invest their time just for the sake of making it
happen.</p>

<p>Premature funding, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/corporate-innovation-strategy-guide">especially by incumbents</a>,
typically ends up replicating the incumbent's hierarchy. In such scenarios, budget ownership replaces vision and ladder climbing skills
replace merit. Of course, <b>we would accept funding that does not imply diverging from our strategic goals</b>. It's just that we cannot
condition building Jazz to funding. We came this far without money, money would buy us time to advance faster, just that. A community is a
collaborative contribution of time, which is money. Somehow, crowd collaboration and crowdfunding look like a better option for now.
And <b>building a community is the way to healthy growth</b>. In early stages, premature business plans just to make the project suitable
for VC, or accepting "money vs. product" imbalance, since the product is not yet assessed as it should be, could end up frustrating the
whole idea.</p>

<p><b>Just to clarify</b>: This is compatible with crowdfunding Jazz-based products. Raising donations and crowdfunding to make products
happen by committing full time dedication of coders is part of the strategy.</p>

<p>And again, <b>not too early</b>! We definitely look forward to build alliances with major players. We believe in going through a period
of austerity that self-selects the team, builds the product and earns respect for the vision. After that, alliances should be built, not
for money, based on goals.</p>

<h3>Why <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr>? A brief Q&amp;A for people not familiar with Open Source Software</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Q1: What if a non Jazz author ignores kaalam and builds her own Jazz company?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This is <b>legal</b> and even <b>good</b> for all of us. It places Jazz in the center of an ecosystem. We should not be afraid to
compete. And honestly, we would compete with an unfair advantage. <b>Free software is a little bit like Texas hold'em</b>. The six open
source repositories are the community cards, but there are thirty other private repositories that are our hole cards. You need all the cards
to win hands. You need the people who can not just answer what was done, but why it was done. You need the people who can deliver new
features, better, faster and understanding all the implications. <b>It is a business model.</b></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Q2: What if some author does not agree on how kaalam evolves and builds her own Jazz company?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Unlike in the previous case, she deeply understands the technology and the vision because she has been "in the trenches" for a
long time. <b>That's okay too</b>! Inevitably, there is always a decision to be made between getting a bigger part of a smaller thing or a
smaller part of a bigger thing. Incompatible visions better become different projects than eternal fights. And again, <b>the more the
merrier</b>. But, of course, when kaalam becomes a corporation we hope not to lose our talent.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Q3: What if the project never reaches the point where it can grow organically and the authors give up?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>That's <b>a real problem</b>. Most projects don't make it. But also here <b>being <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> helps</b>: In an <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> project you own
everything you built and everything everyone else built. It's the magic of software, it multiplies endlessly. If you are thrilled about
making it happen, if you are tired of your next project being yet another end-to-end deep learning model like 10000 similar projects you
see in every conference, if you have enough self-confidence to create something exceptional by just delivering a chunk of it every day,
if you wish to have a say on the advancement of AI (in case, of course, you agree our analysis is more right that wrong)
<b>... you should be part of Jazz!</b></p>

<h3>Just because you passionately believe in it, that does not make it a good idea</h3>

<blockquote>
â€œThe interesting balance you have to get right as an entrepreneur is you have to have a healthy disregard for what other people are saying,
in the sense that if everyone is saying it is a good idea, it is probably too late. You are certainly not five years ahead of your time, you
may be two years behind. The key thing is, how do you not be delusional as well. You can easily just go: I am not going to listen to any
negative feedback. Just because you passionately believe in it, that does not make it a good idea. ... Actually, you can get self-delusional
thinking, you can over-inspire people to the point they are not thinking rationally about what they can actually achieve in a certain amount
of time."
