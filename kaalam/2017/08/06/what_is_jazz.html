			<h1>What is Jazz?</h1>
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/kaalam/assets/images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p><p>We call Jazz a <em>“lightweight all-in-one analytical and AI server”</em>. Let’s analyze this phrase a little more in detail.</p>

<p>In the first place Jazz is a server. This means it provides data and computations based on data to clients. The clients connect to it using its
<abbr title="Representational State Transfer: Introduced in 2000, it is the standard way of communicating clients to servers over http.">REST</abbr> <abbr title="Application Program Interface: The interface that allows clients (computers and smartphones) to communicate data with Jazz.">API</abbr>. Clients can be mobile applications or web based applications. Furthermore, you can also view the clients as data since they are just
blocks of code. Extending the idea, Jazz can store its own clients. You can download your Jazz application from the Jazz server. Basically, anything
a user needs is a web browser or a smartphone.</p>

<p>Jazz is analytical. This means it not only stores blocks of data, but <em>“understands”</em> most of it. Some blocks, for instance an <abbr title="Just a common video standard. This file can be &quot;delivered&quot; by Jazz and played with a browser plug-in, but Jazz does not &quot;understand&quot; it.">mp4 video</abbr> file, do not
make sense to Jazz, but Jazz can still store it and deliver it as a <abbr title="Just a bunch of data, the content of a file with no context information.">raw block</abbr> or a mime typed <abbr title="The same block, but &quot;decorated&quot; with some attributes describing what it is, its language, author, copyright, etc.">http object</abbr>. Other blocks, for instance a <abbr title="A set of data of the same type with a set of dimensions. Examples of tensors include numbers, vectors, matrices, images, videos and more.">tensor</abbr> of
real values representing a color image, <strong>do</strong> make sense and Jazz knows how to make computations with that. Also, as data may be bigger than what
fits on a single <abbr title="A computer running a Jazz server.">node</abbr>, Jazz has support for <abbr title="Dividing a large data instrument over a set of nodes.">sharding</abbr>. Any <abbr title="A computer running a Jazz server.">node</abbr> is aware of the whole <abbr title="A group of computers running Jazz servers that work together and are aware of each other.">cluster</abbr> and can forward computation to the correct place.</p>

<p>Jazz is AI. This means besides the analytical functions one would expect from a data server (<abbr title="Selecting data that matches some condition.">filtering</abbr>, <abbr title="Computing functions over the groups. E.g., Average income of women above 40 in each US State.">aggregating</abbr>, etc.) Jazz can also
compute <abbr title="Aka. &quot;deep learning&quot;. DNNs are architectures of functions. Typically, these networks are created by &quot;learning&quot; iteratively to do tasks by looking at examples, but any network of functions fits here.">deep neural networks</abbr> from the data stored in the server. Recently, AI is becoming an industry and major players are developing <abbr title="Platforms providing functionality to &quot;learn&quot;, &quot;analyze&quot; and &quot;predict&quot; using deep neural networks.">DNN platforms</abbr>.
Jazz delivers support to automatically convert <abbr title="Caffe is a deep learning framework, originally developed by Yangqing Jia as part of his PhD at UC Berkeley. It is open source and written in C++.">Caffe</abbr> models and <abbr title="TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning developed by Google.">TensorFlow</abbr> support is on its way.</p>

<p>Jazz is all-in-one. You can view Jazz as a new type of data server that hasn’t a direct competitor yet. We have combined <abbr title="The way data is stored in a permanent way (as opposed to volatile data in RAM). Data that can be backed up, restored, traced, verified, etc.">persistence</abbr> technology with
<abbr title="Aka. &quot;deep learning&quot;. DNNs are architectures of functions. Typically, these networks are created by &quot;learning&quot; iteratively to do tasks by looking at examples, but any network of functions fits here.">deep neural networks</abbr> and communications. By design, nothing can be faster than a <abbr title="A process is the technical name for a &quot;program&quot; running. Typically, a process has multiple threads and they all see the same memory, unlike different processes which have to communicate between each other if they need to share data.">single process</abbr>. See the section
on <a href="/jazz/2017/08/05/architecture.html">architecture</a> for more.</p>

<p>Jazz is lightweight. It is entirely written in <abbr title="The latest version of C++, an extension of the C computer language appeared in 1983 that is still today the language of use when efficiency is the main concern.">C++14</abbr> and integrates top performing highly reliable open source C and C++ libraries only. A binary
Jazz <abbr title="The binary image of a program with all the dependencies needed to install and run it.">artifact</abbr> has a size of around 20 Mb, is installed in less than a minute and has a startup time of less than a second.</p>

<p>Another interesting Jazz feature is, it can provision its own data by connecting to APIs. For instance, a Jazz server providing value over financial
instruments, does not need to have its data <abbr title="A program connecting to Jazz could be constantly updating its data. This is one of the ways to gather data.">updated by a client</abbr>, it can <abbr title="Jazz itself can connect to public or private data sources and gather data.">pull data sources</abbr> either <abbr title="When a user needs that datum and expects Jazz to provide it.">on demand</abbr> or <abbr title="On a pre-programmed schedule.">periodically</abbr>.</p>
