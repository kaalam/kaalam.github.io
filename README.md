# This whole repository is automatically created!


## What is this?

The website is build under the following separation of concerns:

  - [document.source](https://github.com/kaalam/document.source) is the neat text (as markdown) and image source of the website. This is where authors should edit.
  - [this](https://github.com/kaalam/kaalam.github.io) is the (automatically generated) github pages static content accessible as [kaalam.ai](https://kaalam.github.io/)
  - [kaalam.web.automation](https://github.com/kaalam/kaalam.web.automation) is the automation process creating the latter from the former.
